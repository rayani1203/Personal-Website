                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>Hi, my name is Rayan Ismail and I'm a first year Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. By heritage, I am Indian, although I was born in Saudi Arabia and have also lived in the United States and Canada. I have long had a passion for applied science and mathematics throughout my schooling career, which inspired me to pursue engineering in university and build many crucial skill such as problem solving and critical thinking which combine well with my collaborative and interpersonal nature. I have since been able to nurture my love for software and develop my programming skills in a multitude of languages, including C++, C#, Python, VB.NET, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.JS, and VHDL. I am currently looking for a co-op placement for Fall 2022 where I hope to be able to apply the various skills that I have learned through my past experiences and further develop myself as a programmer, engineer, and student.<br><br>Outside of my academic and professional career, I am a massive sports fanatic. When I'm not wrapped up in the tasks of day to day life, you can nearly always find me with some sort of ball in my hand or at my feet (as pictured left), or watching other people do the same. Some of my favourite sports include, but are not limited to soccer, basketball, football, cricket, table tennis, and Formula 1.</p>
