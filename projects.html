After each guess at cracking the code, the user receives feedback on how many perfect/non-perfect guesses they made, information which can help them logically decipher the code. A matrix was also utilized to keep track of all past guesses and feedback to help the user easily keep track of all the information provided.</p>

The user can select both the size of the board and the amount of bombs in the board. They can then choose to either mark or reveal a location on the board, or restart the game. At any point the game notifies them if an input is invalid, and they can then try again. Many different techniques and functions unique to C# were utilized to create a game that can be played by anyone.</p>

A staff member is created as an instance of a class with the previously stated member variables. These staff members (instances) are then added to a directory which is also its own class that contains a linked list of the staff members. Staff members can then be added or removed from this linked list in a multitude of ways. The linked list can also be sorted by the roles of the staff and the list can also be printed in a number of ways. The declarations for the classes are stored in individual .hpp files with their definitions in a shared .cpp file and the main program being run through main.cpp</p>
