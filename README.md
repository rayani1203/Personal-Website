# Personal-Website

Personal website created as a portfolio to provide a simple, aesthetic way for others to learn more about my background, projects, and experiences. It was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript which allowed me to create a reactive website with various features such as transitions between pages, forms, and dropdown menus. I also utilized online libraries such as particle.js to add interactivity to the website and improve design. Peers and potential employers can use this page as a guiding overview of who I am as a student and potential employee and can then use it to view my projects directly on github, download my resume, or contact me directly.
